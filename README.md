# JAVA-OOP-Concepts
Object Oriented Programming Concepts in Java.

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to languages that uses objects in programming. OOP implements real-world entities like polymorphism and inheritance to bind data together and operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

<h3>Objects:</h3> 
Any entity that has state and behaviour is known as an Object. An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. It is a logical and physical entity.<br>

<h3>Class:</h3> 
A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical. Classes contain fields, constructors, blocks, methods, other nested classes and interfaces.

<h3>Inheritance:</h3>
Inheritance is a Java mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. Types of Inheritance in java:
<ul>
  <li>Single Inheritance - when a class inherits anonther class.</li>
  <li>Multilevel Inheritance - a class extends to another class that is already extended from another class.</li>
  <li>Hierarchical Inheritance - when two or more classes inherit a single class.</li>
  <li>Multiple Inheritance - when a single class inherits two or more parent classes.</li>
  <li>Hybrid Inheritance - Mix of two or more types of inheritances.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Polymorphism:</h3>
Poly means many and morph means form. So polymorphism is nothing but the ability of an object to take more than one form. It is a concept by which we can perform a single action in many different ways.

<h3>Abstraction:</h3>
Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user. The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user.
<br>e.g. when you send message to your friend, you only type the text and send the message. But you donâ€™t know the internal processing of the message delivery.
